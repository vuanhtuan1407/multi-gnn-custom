## Notes
Some files in the original project are modified by our group for research purpose.
If you have any questions, please contact Vu Anh Tuan (vuanhtuan1407@gmail.com).

## Setup
To use the repository, you first need to install the conda environment via 
```
conda env create -f env.yml
```
Otherwise, you can use another setting process (only if you are using Linux)
```
sh setup.sh
```
Then, the data needed for the experiments can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ealtman2019/ibm-transactions-for-anti-money-laundering-aml/data). To use this data with the provided training scripts, you first need to perform a pre-processing step for the downloaded transaction files (e.g. `HI-Small_Trans.csv`):
```
python format_kaggle_files.py /path/to/kaggle-files/HI-Small_Trans.csv
```
Make sure to change the filepaths in the `data_config.json` file. The `aml_data` path should be changed to wherever you stored the `formatted_transactions.csv` file generated by the pre-processing step.

## Usage
To run the experiments, you need to run the `main.py` function and specify any arguments you want to use. There are two required arguments, namely `--data` and `--model`. For the `--data` argument, make sure you store the different datasets in different folders. Then, specify the folder name, e.g `--data Small_HI`. The `--model` parameter should be set to any of the model classed that are available, i.e. to one of `--model [gin, gat, rgcn, pna]`. Thus, to run a standard GNN, you need to run, e.g.:
```
python main.py --data Small_HI --model gin
```
Then you can add different adaptations to the models by selecting the respective arguments from:

<div align="center">

| Argument       | Description                  |
| -------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `--emlps`      | Edge updates via MLPs        |
| `--reverse_mp` | Reverse Message Passing      |
| `--ego`        | Ego ID's to the center nodes |
| `--ports`      | Port Numberings for edges    |

</div>
Thus, to run Multi-GIN with edge updates, you would run the following command:

```
python main.py --data Small_HI --model gin --emlps --reverse_mp --ego --ports
```

## Additional functionalities
There are several arguments that can be set for additional functionality. Here's a list with them:

<div align="center">

| Argument       | Description                                                                                                                                              |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `--tqdm`       | Displays a progress bar during training and inference.                                                                                                   |
| `--save_model` | Saves the best model to the specified `model_to_save` path in the `data_config.json` file. Requires argment `--unique_name` to be specified.             |
| `--finetune`   | Loads a previously trained model (with name given by `--unique_name` and stored in `model_to_load` path in the `data_config.json`) to be finetuned.      |
| `--inference`  | Loads a previously trained model (with name given by `--unique_name` and stored in `model_to_load` path in the `data_config.json`) to do inference only. |
